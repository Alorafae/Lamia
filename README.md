# Lamia
Lamia Engine

VS 2017 Community is current compiler in use.

All libraries are compiled for this in x86 debug, x86 release, x64 debug, and x64 release. 
*(except physfs, currently only x64 release and debug)

Compilation across all four configurations is currently working.

# Goal
This is meant to be a base Vulkan engine to build from and be easy to follow.

# License
The two files (the LamiaGfxUtil files) are under Apache License due to majority of the code coming directly from Valve & LunarG tutorial on Vulkan.

Glslang, SPIRV, and Vulkan are also under Apache License and are not modified.

Physfs is under zlib license and not modified.

GLM utilizes MIT license and is not modified.

All other files are and will be MIT license.
